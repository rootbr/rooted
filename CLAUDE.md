## Orientation

Read `README.md`, then run `./overview.sh` to orient.
Read individual files only if the output is not sufficient for the user's request.

## Evidence-Based Rule

Before adding any rule, checklist item, or review criterion — verify it traces to one of:

| Source | Examples |
|---|---|
| Academic research | arxiv.org, peer-reviewed papers, Google Scholar, PubMed |
| Technical standards | RFCs, official specifications, language/framework docs |
| Verified hands-on experience | Author's real-world usage, confirmed through practice |

No traceable source → do not add.

## Quality Gate

MUST run `/context-engineer` on every SKILL.md or agent prompt change before committing.
