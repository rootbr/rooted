Skills for the full evidence-based preparation pipeline: research any topic with source verification, map its complete question space before you start, then write AI agent context that actually works — grounded instructions and disciplined reasoning instead of vibes. [Research shows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11988) LLM-generated context files *decrease* agent task success and raise inference cost by ~20%. Rooted structurally refuses them: every rule traces to a peer-reviewed paper or an RFC. Software-development and code-review skills apply the same discipline to everyday coding.

- **Evidence-based, not LLM-generated.** Every rule traces to a peer-reviewed paper, RFC/spec, or a hands-on test — not to "ask the model to write a skill."
- **Lean context over static dumps.** For example, instead of an `/init`-style project-structure blob in `CLAUDE.md` (shown to *decrease* agent success and raise cost by ~20% [[15]](#references)), orientation happens on demand via [`overview.sh`](overview.sh) with an explicit stop-instruction. The agent doesn't preemptively slurp the whole tree into context, so it doesn't fill its working memory with project content it doesn't need and later lose focus on the actual task.

## Methodology

Every rule, checklist item, and review criterion traces to one of:

- **Academic research** — arxiv.org, peer-reviewed papers, Google Scholar, PubMed
- **Technical standards** — RFCs, official specifications, language/framework documentation
- **Human-tested** — double-checked and reviewed by a human before commit

## Plugins

### evidence-based-authoring

Research → explore → write. Three skills covering the full preparation pipeline — from gathering verified sources and mapping every angle of a topic, to producing agent instructions grounded in evidence.

| Skill | Description |
|--|--|
| `/researching-topics` | Research any topic on the web with source verification and critical analysis |
| `/discovering-subtopics` | Build a maximum-breadth question map across any topic using 10 complementary methods — structural decomposition, perspective shifting, causal chains, and more |
| `/auditing-ai-context` | Audit and optimize any AI agent context: CLAUDE.md, SKILL.md, prompts, instructions. Adapt project docs for AI consumption |

### code-quality

| Skill | Description |
|--|--|
| `/reviewing-java` | Deep Java code review with parallel specialist agents and verification. [Details](plugins/code-quality/skills/reviewing-java/README.md) |
| `/cleaning-code` | Improve code readability and maintainability |
| `/committing-changes` | Review changes and create atomic commits following Conventional Commits |

```

Install plugins:

```

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Every new rule must cite a source — an arXiv ID, an RFC number, or a linked hands-on test. PRs without citations are rejected by design, not by oversight.

For the full cross-check of each paper against the research questions this marketplace tries to answer, see the [research audit](research/2026-04-18_context-engineering-research.md) — findings extracted per paper, including tangential results that inform but do not yet back a specific skill rule.
